# Dog

Dog.cpp has the same functionality as the cat command.

## Compiling

run the command make which will compile the necessary dog.cpp file and create a dog object.

```bash
make
```

## Running the program

To run the program type ./dog and follow it with any file you want to display on your console.
```bash
./dog testfile.txt testfile2.txt
./dog
./dog - testfile.txt
```

## Limitations

As far as I know dog should exactly like cat except for the fact that it does not take care of double dashes and flags.
